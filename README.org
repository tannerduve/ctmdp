#+html: <p align="center"><strong>ctmdp</strong> A simple Python implementation for categorical semantics of Markov decision processes</p>

** Getting started

This package is inspired by [[https://github.com/mvcisback/dfa][dfa]] and intends
to generalize its behavior
the Markov decision process (MDP) setting.

** Examples
The examples are located in the `examples` folder.
To run an example run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 -m examples.mdp
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 -m examples.box_product
#+END_SRC
etc.

** Planned Features
*** Package and add to pypi
Use poetry or uv
*** jupytext examples
*** visualization backend
For example to graphviz or tikz
*** bridge to gymnasium
*** more experiments and examples
- box product
- quotients of MDPs
- ...
