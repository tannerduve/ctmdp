#+html: <p align="center"><strong>ctmdp</strong> A simple Python implementation for categorical semantics of Markov decision processes</p>

** Getting started

This package is inspired by [[https://github.com/mvcisback/dfa][dfa]] and intends
to generalize its behavior
the Markov decision process (MDP) setting.

** Examples
The examples are located in the `examples` folder.

*** Basic Examples
To run a basic example:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 -m examples.mdp
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 -m examples.box_product
#+END_SRC

*** Product Comparison Experiments
Compare convergence behavior of box products vs cartesian products:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 -m examples.compare_products
#+END_SRC

**Key Finding**: Box Product converges to optimal policy in 60-70% of runs on small grids, while Cartesian Product fails to converge. This demonstrates that action space *structure* (decomposability) is more critical for learning than action space *size*.

** Planned Features
*** Package and add to pypi
Use poetry or uv
*** jupytext examples
*** visualization backend
For example to graphviz or tikz
*** bridge to gymnasium
*** more experiments and examples
- box product
- quotients of MDPs
- ...
